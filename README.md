This is the step-by-step course with freecodecamp 38-hour course on youtube.

# Notes App
It's a simple note app, but the code is very robust and clean
- Authenticating using fireabse
- Storage using firebase and sqflite
- Bloc state managment
- Localization with english and (almost) arabic
- working well on android, ios (for my code version) needs some modifications
